description: Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store,
  used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as
  strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs
  and geospatial indexes with radius queries. Redis has built-in replication, Lua
  scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of on-disk persistence,
  and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with
  Redis Cluster.

# MirrorMaker 2.0

MM2 leverages the Connect framework to replicate topics between Kafka clusters. MM2 includes several new features, including:

 - both topics and consumer groups are replicated
 - topic configuration and ACLs are replicated
 - cross-cluster offsets are synchronized
 - partitioning is preserved

## Replication flows 

MM2 replicates topics and consumer groups from upstream source clusters to downstream target clusters. These directional flows are notated
`A->B`.

It's possible to create complex replication topologies based on these `source->target` flows, including:

 - *fan-out*, e.g. `K->A, K->B, K->C`
 - *aggregation*, e.g. `A->K, B->K, C->K`
 - *active/active*, e.g. `A->B, B->A`

Each replication flow can be configured independently, e.g. to replicate specific topics or groups:

    A->B.topics = topic-1, topic-2
    A->B.groups = group-1, group-2

By default, all topics and consumer groups are replicated (except excluded ones), across all enabled replication flows. Each
replication flow must be explicitly enabled to begin replication:

    A->B.enabled = true
    B->A.enabled = true

Please ensure that you have an external database that is ready and accessible at {{ .Values.dbAddress }}
The database must be initialized and ready to use by Keycloak.

Please wait for a couple of minutes until Keycloak is totally up. There is a readiness probe set up for this that checks if everything is up and running after an initial delay of 150 seconds. If a large number of replicas is specified, keycloak instances may take longer to be ready, as they all connect to the same shared database.
    Note that the keycloak server runs about 20 seconds after the docker container is initialized.

If the readiness probe fails, it means that the ingress path (default /access) page at the specified HTTPS Port is not accessible and therefore something is not working as intended.
    If this occurs, please make sure that correct database information and login credentials are provided; otherwise, Keycloak will not work properly. The keycloak docker image REQUIRES an external shared database.

The following command can help to check keycloak logs:
    kubectl -n <namespace> logs <pod-name> -c <keycloak-container-name> -f

{{ if .Release.IsInstall }}
Keycloak admin password is: {{ template "ckey.getAdminPassword" . }}
{{ end }}

Remember to make sure that correct database information and credentials are provided; otherwise, Keycloak will not work properly.
